# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

This project applies **machine learning** to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a **term deposit** based on the Bank Marketing dataset. By analyzing client demographics, financial details, and past interactions, the project helps optimize marketing strategies, reduce campaign costs, and improve subscription conversion rates.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes client demographics, call durations, and campaign effectiveness.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.  
- **Insights for Marketing**: Identifies key features that influence client decisions (e.g., duration of contact, previous outcome, client age).

## Why This Project?
Direct marketing campaigns can be costly, and banks must **prioritize clients who are most likely to subscribe**. Traditional approaches rely on mass outreach, leading to wasted efforts and higher expenses. This project demonstrates how **predictive analytics** can significantly improve **targeted marketing efficiency**.
